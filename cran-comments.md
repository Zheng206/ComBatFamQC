## Resubmission of version 1.0.6

## Change in version 1.0.6
1. Added the systemfonts package as a suggested dependency and implemented a skip mechanism for both com_shiny() and age_shiny() if the package is not installed. This should resolve the testing issue on r-oldrel-macos-arm64.

2. Updated the wording in the Shiny app layout and fixed minor typos.
